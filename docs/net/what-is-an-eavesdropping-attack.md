窃听攻击也称为嗅探或探听攻击，是网络安全的一个主要问题。通过这些攻击，您的信息(如密码、卡详细信息和其他敏感数据)在从一台设备传输到另一台设备时很容易被窃取。

这些类型的攻击最成功，因为它们在传输过程中不会发出任何警报，因为它们利用不安全的网络通信来访问用户发送或接收的数据。正如 3i 的应用和安全经理汤姆·金所写的那样

*窃听攻击是阴险的，因为很难知道它们正在发生。一旦连接到网络，用户可能会不知不觉地将敏感信息(密码、账号、上网习惯或电子邮件内容)提供给攻击者。*

假设你是一名远程员工，你正在通过开放网络向你的老板传递一些敏感的商业信息。此时，网络攻击者可以悄悄入侵并放置一些软件，通过这些软件他可以窃听网络路径并捕获所有重要信息。这是窃听攻击的典型例子。这些攻击可能导致财务损失、身份被盗或隐私丢失等。

## 窃听方法:

攻击者使用各种方法或技术来监听对话或查看网络活动，方法是使用:

*   The pickup device picks up the sound or image from the connected microphone and camera, and then the attacker can convert it into electronic format to eavesdrop on the target. Attackers can also use micro amplifiers to help them minimize background noise.
*   The transmission link between the sender and the receiver will be eavesdropped to eavesdrop. This can be done by radio frequency transmission or electric wires, including active or unused telephone lines, electric wires or ungrounded electric wires. Some transmitters can work continuously, but another method is remote activation.
*   A listening post is when we put a bug on the phone to hear an ongoing conversation. It uses a trigger to record when you pick up the phone to make or receive a call, and it will automatically turn off when the call ends. The safe area where these recordings are monitored is called a listening station. It can be anywhere, they have voice activated devices that can eavesdrop and record every activity.
*   When using weak passwords, attackers are more likely to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This gives them a way to invade the company system and network. Network attackers take advantage of these advantages to enter confidential communication channels, intercept activities, monitor conversations between colleagues and steal confidential business data.
*   Users who connect to the open network that do not need any password or use encryption to transmit data provide an ideal scenario for attackers to eavesdrop. Attackers can easily monitor users' activities and listen to the communication on the network.

## 窃听攻击示例:

攻击者通常在寻找可用于犯罪目的的敏感信息，包括通话记录、业务策略和财务细节。一些例子是:

*   Spouse software allows people to eavesdrop on their important others by tracking their smartphone usage or location details and checking all their activities.
*   When a user connects to a public wi-fi network (such as a free network such as a train station or cafe), he or she can obtain the login credentials of hackers attacking his or her Facebook account or email id or stealing his or her card details.
*   Intelligent speech recognition assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Home are also vulnerable to eavesdropping, because their "always on" mode poses a great threat to users' privacy.
*   Wireshark is a sniffer program, which brought a lot of trouble to Android smartphone users as early as 2011\. In this attack, the authentication token is sent through the unencrypted wireless network, which causes Wireshark to view, steal, modify or even delete all confidential data.
*   In 2015, due to a bug in the open source code base AFNetworking, more than 25,000 iOS applications were vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, and even iOS suffered losses. Because of this bug, HTTPS encryption may be dismantled.

## 防窃听攻击:

*   避免使用公共无线网络。
*   使用虚拟专用网络。
*   设置强密码并经常更改。
*   不要重复你注册的每个网站的密码。
*   用杀毒软件保护你的电脑并保持更新。
*   使用个人防火墙。
*   避免点击可疑或不可靠的链接。
*   确保您的手机使用的是最新版本的操作系统。
*   仅从安卓或苹果商店等可信来源下载应用。
*   军用级加密是防御窃听攻击的一个很好的方法，因为攻击者需要大约 5000 亿年才能解码它。
