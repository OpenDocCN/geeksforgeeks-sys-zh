# 如何设置局域网？

局域网(局域网)是一种数据通信网络，在本地连接工作站、服务器、路由器等网络设备。在一个小区域内共享资源，如一个建筑或校园。工作站之间建立物理或无线连接以共享资源。以太网和 Wi-fi 是[**【LAN】**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/local-area-network-lan-technologies/)最重要的技术。家庭、学校、办公室等的个人网络。都是局域网的例子。这些通常是私有网络。

**设置局域网的要求:**

*   **Workstation/personal equipment:** Notebook computer, computer, mobile phone, etc.
*   **Network equipment:** Router, switch, modem (if not already in the router)
*   **Shared resources:** Printers, disk drives, etc.
*   **Cable:** Ethernet cable, the wire connecting other devices (in the case of wired LAN)
*   **Internet connection:** Wi-Fi (in case of WLAN)

### **设置局域网的说明:**

设置局域网应遵循以下步骤:

1.  **Identification service:** Identify network services, such as printers, disk drives, data, etc. Will be shared between workstations.
2.  **Identification equipment:** Identify computers, mobile phones, notebook computers and other equipment. Have a unique address that will connect to the network.
3.  **Planning connection:** Design the network by arranging cables or making wireless connection between network devices. Wired local area network is set up by using Ethernet cable, while wireless local area network is used to connect network devices without any physical connection setting. Wired LAN is more secure than wireless LAN, but it is difficult to relocate.
4.  **Select networking equipment:** Select a switch or router with enough ports to connect all workstations in the network. The selection of network equipment is based on the requirements of the network.
5.  **Configure ports:** Configure WAN ports according to the information provided by [ISP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/isp-full-form/) (Internet service provider). In addition, configure the LAN port of the cable router so that all workstations in the network have enough available addresses. Wired routers act as [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) (Dynamic Host Configuration Server) servers, and automatically assign addresses to all devices connected to the network.
6.  **Establish connection:** Connect all devices with wires and configure local area network. Standard Ethernet cable is used to connect workstation and server, while Ethernet crossover cable is used to connect switch to cable router by connecting standard port of switch to LAN port of router. For wireless LAN, use [SSID](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/service-set-identifier-ssid-in-computer-network/) (Service Set Identifier) provided by router or switch to connect all devices to wireless network to configure LAN network.
7.  **Test the network:** Test every workstation connected to the network to ensure that every workstation can access the network service.

### **着陆提示**设置 **:**

1.  在进行实际连接之前，对连接做一个全面的计划，以避免混淆。
2.  仔细确定网络的要求和规模，并进行相应的规划。
3.  明智地选择为网络提供更多灵活性的网络设备。
4.  确保电缆长度不超过 100 米。
5.  除非防火，否则避免在风道中铺设电缆。
6.  在网络建立后执行详细测试，以分析网络的实际性能。

**局域网的应用:**

1.  **Resource sharing:** Local area network allows workstations connected to the network to share resources such as printers, scanners and optical drives. This reduces the cost of network establishment.
2.  **Software sharing:** Local area network allows a single copy of licensed software to be shared among workstations connected to the network, instead of purchasing separate software for each computer.
3.  **Internet sharing:** LAN is convenient for all devices connected to the network to share the Internet connection.
4.  **Data sharing:** LAN allows different workstations to share data and files. It also allows access to data stored on the central server.
5.  **Communication:** Devices connected to the local area network can communicate with each other.

**局域网的优势:**

1.  In a small geographical location, this is a simple and cheap way of communication.
2.  By connecting workstations to the central server, it is easy to expand the network.
3.  It is easy to manage resources and data from a central server.
4.  It is more secure because the data is stored on the central server, which refuses to access the data illegally.
5.  High data transmission rate.

**LAN 的缺点:**

1.  The initial setting cost is high.
2.  It violates the privacy of network users because administrators can access all their data and files.
3.  If the central server is not properly protected, it may face security problems.
4.  Regular maintenance is required to deal with software installation, hardware failure, cable disturbance and other issues.
5.  It limits the scale of the network.
