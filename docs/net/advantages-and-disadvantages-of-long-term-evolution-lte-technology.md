**长期演进(LTE)** 技术如今非常有名(2020 年)。这是因为使用这项技术的 4G 智能手机的使用越来越多。LTE 是为蜂窝移动通信系统开发高性能空中接口的项目名称。它用于推进一系列移动电信系统。这是一个高速数据网络。它是智能手机和移动设备最快的无线网络。

**优势:**

1.  Participants can exchange data and voice. This is because LTE supports packet switching.
2.  A large amount of data can be transmitted between the sender and the receiver.
3.  All data exchanges are carried out with very low power consumption. This leads to longer battery life of smart phones.
4.  File upload and download speed is fast.
5.  Release network usage faster. This reduces the network load.
6.  This will reduce traffic and reduce crashes in the service.
7.  With LTE, you can easily watch live programs, competitions and events.

**缺点:**

1.  This service is not available in all cities at present.
2.  More towers and new technologies need to be developed to get better signals during transportation, such as on buses and trains.
3.  LTE is complex, and only skilled people are needed to manage the system. They even need to get higher wages.
4.  This technology can't be used on older smartphones.
5.  Buying a new smartphone for LTE is an expensive thing.
