[增强现实(AR)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-augmented-reality/) 是一种沉浸式技术。增强现实是数字内容在现实世界环境中的叠加。虚拟对象可以是各种形式:图像、视频或交互式数据。

**AR 是如何工作的？**

*   AR uses computer vision, mapping, and depth tracking to display appropriate content to the user. This feature allows the camera to collect, send and process data to display digital content suitable for viewing by any user.
*   In augmented reality, the user's physical environment is enhanced in real time by context-related digital content. You can experience augmented reality with your smartphone or special hardware.
*   Augmented reality applications embedded in text, images, videos, etc. are being developed.

**增强现实技术的应用:**

*   The application of AR in construction projects includes the use of mobile devices and 3D models to place the proposed 3D model in the existing space.
*   Mobile AR is a creative and efficient educational and entertainment tool, which adds an extra layer of information to everyday objects and environments-3D characters, images, videos, texts, sounds and so on.
*   Allows users to test the application of products in real time through AR technology.
*   Away from the hotel environment, some companies in the tourism industry are developing augmented reality applications, which allow visitors to enhance their physical location and tourist attractions. This allows users to point their smartphones at buildings or landmarks and learn more information in real time.
*   And printing and advertising industries are using AR technology applications to display digital content in real-world magazines.
*   AR technology allows you to develop translation applications to help you explain the text for you in other languages.
*   With the help of Unity 3D Engine tool, AR is being used to develop real-time 3D games.
