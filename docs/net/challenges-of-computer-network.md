在[互联网](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-internet-and-the-web/)时代，每个人都喜欢用电脑和智能手机工作，没有网络就不可能想到任何工作。随着技术的进步，计算机网络的使用正在迅速增加。总的来说，如果我们将看到，我们也可以感受到网络是多么重要，这可能是我们的日常社交网络，也可能是这种技术计算机网络一切都在一个过程中，通过网络给予另一种生活方式，使人类生活变得更好。

在当今的商业世界中，**计算机网络**已经成为常态。今天的网络比以往任何时候都支持更多的流量。不仅仅是电脑，智能手机也加入其中，如今[物联网](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-internet-of-things-iot-set-1/)也正在成为其中的一大部分。然而，在设计和维护它们时，它们会带来一系列独特的挑战。

在小型网络中，很容易忽略小问题，但在大型网络中，很难识别和应对这些挑战，因为这可能会使整个网络基础设施随之瘫痪。次要和常见的计算机网络问题可以很容易地识别和处理，但有些问题可能很难处理，让我们讨论一下这些计算机网络挑战。但是在讨论网络挑战之前，让我们先看一下这个计算机网络，然后我们可以分析一下我们日常生活中经常面临的计算机网络挑战。

[计算机网络](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-computer-networking/)是信息技术(IT)中通信的基础。它指的是一组相互链接的计算机，使一台计算机能够与另一台计算机通信以共享信息和资源。这些连接到网络的设备通过数字互连使用一组[网络协议](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-protocols/)，以共享位于网络节点上或由网络节点提供的资源。节点之间的互连是基于各种[网络拓扑](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-network-topology/)形成的。

**计算机网络的常见挑战:**

1.  **Performance Degradation –**
    Many time we have faced loss in data integrity and speed of a network which is generally down to poor transmissions and is also known as performance degradation. Every networks that may be large or small performance issue is everywhere but in large networks this performance degradation issue is high as communication has to be established with in a larger area and also by help of many network devices.
2.  **Security Issues –**
    When it comes to computer network there this security issue arises. It is one of top issue of computer network and a big challenge to network security engineers which generally involve protecting network from different cyber attacks, preventing unauthorized users to enter and access system, and maintaining network integrity. All these security issues increases with increase in network size when network size is large there chance of security issues are more.
3.  **Host Identification –**
    Small networks can be easily configured with help of manual addressing, but this becomes a serious problem in large networks when it comes to host identification. Because without any proper address of networking it becomes difficult to establish communication in network. So proper host identification is necessary for a network communication.
4.  **Configuration Conflicts –**
    Mainly large networks have to deal with configuration conflicts and busy networks, since a lot more traffic is going through it. But in small networks a couple of thousand IP addresses with unique host names are available so there is less chance of conflict in between devices. But now a days this problem is less as network structures are designed in such a way that deals with configuration conflicts.
5.  **Capacity Concern –**
    Now a days volume of data is so high which is produced from various sources. So network capacity also needs to grow with respect it. Today we are dealing with trends like Internet of Things (IoT), [Big Data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-big-data/), [Data science](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-data-science/) etc and next year something new will be also added so networks also need to improve capacity needs as well as facing cyber threats.
6.  **Slow Connectivity –**
    Slow connectivity over a network is more frustrating where a simple task takes a long time to be performed over network. It’s often caused by large file transfers over a large area through network. It becomes an unwanted challenge for users when they work over computer network.
7.  **监控和维护–**
    全球网络的监控和维护是当前的一大挑战。在大型网络中监控流量变得非常困难。
