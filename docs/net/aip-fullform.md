**AIP** 或**自适应互联网协议**可以被分类为允许在不同平台上运行的各种应用在各种客户端系统上广泛显示的多通道协议。它为现有的 IP 网络搭建了一座桥梁，以满足未来的网络架构需求。它有各种显示和输入服务。它还支持打印设备、音频和设备映射服务。

**特点:**

*   AIP follows the network architecture for the third layer.
*   It supports up to 24-bit colors, that is, it provides a palette of 16.7 million colors.
*   It provides 256-bit encryption tools through [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-aes-and-des-ciphers/) encryption algorithm.
*   Provide security for the transport layer.
*   It provides audio support, that is, audio programs running on remote servers can be redirected to local computers by users.
*   It provides file system redirection function, that is, files can be run on remote computers without using terminal sessions.
*   It provides printer redirection function, allowing users to use local printers in application sessions, just like using local or network shared printers.
*   Provide port redirection function, allowing applications running in terminal sessions to directly access the local serial port.
*   It allows remote computers and local computers to share the clipboard.

**优势:**

*   AIP supports remote display of multiple applications to the same client at the same time.
*   AIP provides applications running on UNIX, Windows and other platforms, and related equipment services required by these platforms.
*   Use firewall friendly method to configure the protocol.
*   Because the virtual display layer and application layer are separated from each other, AIP provides a higher level of security and mobility.
*   Dynamic monitoring of performance makes AIP an adaptive protocol.
*   The communication between the client and the server is handled by telemetry technology built in the protocol, which provides the best communication method for the server.
*   It provides the best network performance for clients and can handle different bandwidth conditions.

**缺点:**

*   You need to purchase a license to use AIP.
