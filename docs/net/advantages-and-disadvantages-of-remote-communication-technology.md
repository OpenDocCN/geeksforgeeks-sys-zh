**远程通信**可以是一种信息通信，其中数据在两个或多个小工具之间传输和获取，而不使用任何电线或电缆。远程通信是两个或多个焦点之间的数据或控制的交换，这些焦点不是由电导体关联的。最常见的远程进步利用无线电波。

**远程通信技术类型:**

1.  Radio identification of recurrence.
2.  Global positioning system.
3.  Radio and television broadcasting
4.  Bluetooth
5.  无线网络
6.  mobile phone
7.  Today communication
8.  broadcasting station

**远程通信的优势:**

1.  The introduction and maintenance cost of the remote system is lower.
2.  Data transmission speed is faster and faster.
3.  Compared with other network frameworks, the maintenance and establishment consumption is reduced.
4.  Wireless arrangement can be reached anytime, anywhere.
5.  Effective-Reduce cable acquisition, maintenance, etc.
6.  Clients can share records with other organization-related gadgets without using any cables.
7.  Information is transmitted faster and faster.
8.  Simple installation.

**远程通信的缺点:**

1.  It is surprising that the remote system can't do anything about impedance, so radio signals, radiation and any other similar impedance may cause the remote arrangement to collapse.
2.  Security–unauthorized individuals can effectively acquire remote signals.
3.  Control consumption.
4.  The expansion structure will lack operation.

**远程设备类型:**

1.  Remote printer
2.  Remote adapter
3.  Remote router
