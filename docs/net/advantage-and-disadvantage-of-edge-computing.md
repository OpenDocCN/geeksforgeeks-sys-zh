**边缘计算**支持在网络边缘对数据进行分析、处理和传输。也就是说，数据是在本地进行分析的，更接近数据存储的位置，实时且无延迟。边缘计算允许来自物联网设备的数据在被发送到数据中心或云之前在网络边缘被分析。

**优势:**

*   It provides high speed, low latency and better reliability, so that data processing and content delivery can be faster.
*   It provides better security by distributing processing, storage and applications in various devices and data centers, which makes it difficult for any single interruption to destroy the network.
*   It provides a much lower-cost way of scalability and versatility, allowing companies to expand their computing power by combining [IoT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-of-things-and-careers-in-iot/) devices with edge data centers.

**缺点:**

*   More storage capacity is required.
*   Because of the huge amount of data, the security challenge of edge computing is great.
*   It only analyzes data.
*   The cost of edge calculation is very high.
*   It needs advanced infrastructure.
