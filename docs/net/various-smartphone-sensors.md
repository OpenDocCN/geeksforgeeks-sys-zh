**传感器**是智能手机中用于检测环境各方面的设备。他们感知数据，并据此工作。智能手机内置了各种传感器，有助于智能手机的运行。基本上，它们为更好的用户体验而工作。

1.  **Motion Sensors –**
    Motion sensors are useful for monitoring device movement, such as tilt, shake, rotation, or swing. Smartphones identify their orientation through use of an accelerometer. The motion sensors present in accelerometer can be used to detect earthquakes or in medical devices.
2.  **环境传感器–**
    环境传感器用于检测温度、湿度和热量损失。基本上，它用于监控环境参数。他们发明了气体传感器、湿度传感器等传感器。

*   **Position Sensors –**
    The Android smartphone provides two sensors that let you determine position of device- geomagnetic field sensor with combination of accelerometer sensor.*   **Ambient Light Sensor –**
    This sensor works in controlling brightness level of screen. It is available in almost every smartphone ranging from mid to high. If you have put your smartphone to Auto-brightness mode, then when you move out in light, there your phone will automatically boost brightness of the screen. When you come in dark, then with help of this sensor, phone’s brightness will become dim. Depending on intensity of light, this sensor manages brightness of the screen.*   **Proximity Sensor –**
    They are available in almost every smartphone at top of the screen. Infrared light flows through this sensor. When any physical object comes in contact with this light, it detects it and reacts towards it.
    For example, when you talk on your phone and place your phone on your ear, infrared light detects physical object i.e, your ear. Sensing that, screen’s light automatically goes off. This saves both battery life and prevents accidental screen touches.*   **Accelerometer Sensor –**
    It is most important sensor which should be available in every smartphone. It helps phone to check its orientation.
    For Example, if you rotate your phone in landscape mode, then all icons present on screen also moves to landscape mode, and when you want you can change it into portrait mode, this is because of these sensors.*   **Gyroscope Sensor –**
    You must have heard about it’s name. Virtual Reality is possible only because of these types of sensors. If you buy VR head set, put your phone inside, than that is only possible because of gyroscope sensors. Even 360 degree pictures or videos and AR (Augmented Reality) is possible only because of these sensors. These sensors helps phone to know that which axis (Angles and Directions) it is is using at that point of time in very precise manner. Basically, it adjusts contents of phone according to user.*   **Barometer Sensor –**
    These sensors are not available in every phone, it is available in high range phone. This is used for detecting altitude (height) data.
    For Example, The health app in smartphones also uses these sensors. Going up from stairs or moving from ground level to floor level, every detail is given by barometer sensor precisely and data is sent to GPS which then is calculated. It also helps in GPS.*   **Compass Sensor –**
    Compass sensor is very normal and available in every phone, helps in detecting direction like normal compass do.

    还有各种其他传感器对智能手机来说并不太重要，但仍然存在。

    *   **计步器传感器–**
        它计算你走了多少步。它仅适用于高端设备和某些特定设备。
    *   **霍尔传感器–**
        与手机相比，它基本上用在平板电脑上。如果您为平板电脑购买翻盖外壳，当您打开该外壳时，不按任何按钮，屏幕上的灯将自动启动，它将启动平板电脑，当您关闭翻盖时，灯将熄灭。
    *   **IR Blaster–**
        从低到高，小米的每一款手机都有。对于其他公司来说，并不是每个手机都有。这些传感器用于控制电子设备。
        例如，如果手机里有 IR Blaster，可以通过智能手机控制电视、交流电或任何其他电子设备。
