**卫星通信**是放置在轨道上的电子通信包。它的主要目标是启动或协助穿越太空。它为国际交流模式做出了重大贡献。

卫星微波基本上是太空中的微波中继站。它使用地球同步卫星来中继从地面站发射的无线电信号。对于通信信号，这些卫星充当中继站。从地球站，卫星接收数据/信号，放大它们，并将其重新传输到另一个地球站。使用这种装置，数据只需一步就可以传输到地球的另一端。大多数使用**卫星微波**的公司以高昂的费用租赁卫星使用权。

卫星通信有多个优势:

**优势:**

*   Through satellite transmission, the geographical area covered is quite large, mainly for sparsely populated areas.
*   High bandwidth.
*   And wireless communication applications can be easily established by satellite communication independent of location.
*   Widely used in [global mobile communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/global-mobile-satellite-system/) , private business network, long-distance telephone transmission, weather forecast, radio/television signal broadcasting, military intelligence collection, navigation of ships and aircraft, connection to remote areas, television distribution, etc.
*   Security in satellite transmission is usually provided by codec equipment.
*   The services of a single provider are easily available and provide unified services.
*   If it's long distance, it can be cheaper.
*   In satellite communication, laying and maintenance are easy and cheap, so it is the best alternative.
*   In an emergency, each earth station may be relatively quickly removed from a certain location and reinstalled elsewhere.

*   The ground station is easy to install and maintain.

    **Disadvantages:**

    *   The design, development, investment and insurance of satellites all need high cost.
    *   The time from the earth to the satellite can vary from 270 milliseconds to 320 milliseconds to return again. This propagation delay will cause echo on the telephone connection
    *   Satellite is not easy to repair and maintain.
    *   Weather or sunspots will affect satellite signals and cause interference, which makes the normal operation of satellites very difficult.
    *   It requires regular monitoring and control to stay in orbit after launch.
