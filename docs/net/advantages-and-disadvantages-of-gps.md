[全球定位系统(GPS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-gps-works/) 可能是一个基于卫星的定位系统，属于美国政府，属于美国空军。全球定位系统的基本技术是计算接收器之间的距离，并在相同的时间确定观测卫星。卫星的位置被预测并与全球定位系统信号一起广播给用户。通过(卫星的)各种确定的位置，并因此重新测量接收器和卫星之间的距离，通常确定接收器的位置。位置的差异，也可以根据时间来确定，就是接收器的速度。

这些卫星通常位于地球上方 20，000 千米的最高点，速度为 14000 千米/小时。这些卫星以阳光的速度发送信号。

全球定位系统利用“三边测量”的数学原理计算出一个物体的位置，这是一个由 30 多颗卫星组成的环绕世界运行的系统。

**参与 GPS 工作的实体是**

*   Satellite (space segment).
*   Control system (operated by US military).
*   signal
*   The position of satellites can be known from the signals they broadcast to the receiver.
*   These signals are received by receivers connected in the object to be located.
*   The important point here is that at least four satellites are needed to drive the precise positioning of the receiver on the earth.
*   Three satellites are used to track the situation.
*   Use the fourth satellite to verify the target position of the satellite.
*   GPS receiver acquires knowledge from satellites and uses triangulation strategy to calculate the accurate position of users.

**全球定位系统的优势:**

*   GPS is very easy to navigate, because it will tell you the direction of every turn, otherwise you will need to think hard to reach your destination.
*   GPS is fully suitable for weather, so you won't worry about climate like other navigation devices.
*   Compared with other navigation systems, the cost of GPS is very low.
*   The most attractive part of this technology lies in its 100% coverage on the earth.
*   It can also help you find nearby restaurants, hotels and gas stations, which is extremely useful for finding alternative places.
*   Because of its low cost, it is easy to integrate into other technologies such as telephone.
*   The system is updated regularly by the US government, so it is very advanced.
*   This is the simplest navigation system in water, because in large water bodies, we are often misled due to the lack of correct direction.
*   GPS signals are everywhere. Therefore, users will not lose it anywhere.
*   GPS is often used anywhere in the world. It is powered by the world satellites, so it is often visited anywhere. A robust tracking system and a GPS receiver are what you want.

**全球定位系统的缺点:**

*   Sometimes, for some reason, the global positioning system may fail. In this case, you need to keep a backup map and directions.
*   If you use GPS on battery-powered equipment, battery failure may also occur. You need an external power supply, but this is not always possible.
*   Sometimes, due to some obstacles of buildings, trees and other signals, and sometimes due to extreme atmospheric conditions such as geomagnetic storms, GPS signals are not accurate.
*   The GPS chip is in urgent need of power, and it will run out of batteries after 8 to 12 hours. This requires frequent battery replacement or recharging.
*   GPS does not penetrate solid walls or structures. It is also influenced by large buildings or structures.
