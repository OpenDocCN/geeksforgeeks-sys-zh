这些解释如下。

*   **Tier-1 ISP:** 
    These ISPs are at the top of the hierarchy and they have a global reach they do not pay for any internet traffic through their network instead lower-tier ISPs have to pay a cost for passing their traffic from one geolocation to another which is not under the reach of that ISPs. Generally, ISPs at the same level connect to each other and allow free traffic passes to each other. Such ISPs are called peers. Due to this cost is saved. They build infrastructure, such as the Atlantic Internet sea cables, to provide traffic to all other Internet service providers, not to end users.
