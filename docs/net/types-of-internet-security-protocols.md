在当今世界，我们大量传输数据，这些数据的安全性非常重要，因此互联网安全提供了这一功能，即保护数据。存在不同类型的协议，如路由、邮件传输和远程通信协议。但是互联网安全协议有助于互联网上数据的安全性和完整性。有许多协议有助于互联网上的数据安全，例如 [**【安全套接字层】**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/)[**【传输层安全性】**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-security-tls/) 。

**现在，我们来看看各种类型的互联网安全协议:**

1.  **SSL 哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟** **:**
    *   SSL protocol stands for Secure Sockets Layer protocol, which is an internet security protocol based on encryption, protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data.
    *   SSL is used to ensure the privacy and authenticity of data on the Internet.
    *   Located between SSL application layer and transport layer.
    *   At first, SSL contained security flaws, which was quickly replaced by the first version of TLS, which is why SSL is the predecessor of modern TLS encryption.
    *   There is "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP" in the URL of TLS/SSL website.
    *   SSL is divided into three sub-protocols: handshake protocol, record protocol and alarm protocol.
2.  **TLS 哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟哟** **:**
    *   Like SSL, TLS stands for transport layer security and is widely used for data privacy and security on the Internet.
    *   The TLS pseudo-random algorithm is used to generate the master secret, which is the key used for encryption between the protocol client and the protocol server.
    *   TLS is basically used for encrypted communication between online servers, just as a web browser loads web pages in online servers.
    *   There are also three sub-protocols of TLS that are the same as SSL protocol-handshake protocol, record protocol and alarm protocol.
3.  **SHTTP:**
    *   SHTTP stands for Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is a collection of security measures such as establishing strong passwords, setting firewalls, thinking about anti-virus protection, etc., aiming at ensuring the security of Internet communication.
    *   SHTTP includes a data entry form for entering data that has been previously collected in the database. And internet-based transactions.
    *   The service of SHTTP is equivalent to that of SSL protocol.
    *   Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol works at the application layer (which defines the shared communication protocol and interface method used by hosts in the network), so it is closely connected with HTTP.
    *   SHTTP can authenticate and encrypt HTTP traffic between client and server.
    *   SHTTP runs on a message-by-message basis. It can encrypt and sign a single message.
4.  [**设置协议**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-electronic-transaction-set-protocol/) **:**
    *   Secure electronic transaction (Set) is a method to ensure the security and integrity of electronic transactions with credit cards.
    *   SET is not a payment system; On the contrary, it is a secure transaction protocol used through the Internet.
    *   SET protocol provides the following services:
        *   It establishes a secure communication channel between the parties engaged in e-commerce transactions.
        *   It provides confidentiality, because information is provided to both parties only when they need it.
    *   SET agreement includes the following participants:
        *   **Cardholder**
        *   **Merchant**
        *   **Issuer**
        *   obtain
        *   **payment gateway**
        **认证机构**

5.  RFC 1421, RFC 1422, RFC 1423 and RFC 1424 are four specific papers explaining privacy enhanced email protocols.
6.  It can perform encryption operations such as encryption, non-repudiation and message integrity.
7.  [T0】 PGP protocol:
    *   PGP protocol represents good privacy, easy to use and free of charge, including its source code documents.
    *   It also conforms to the basic principles of cryptography.
    *   Compared with PEM protocol, the popularity and usage of PGP protocol have increased.
    *   PGP protocol includes encryption functions such as encryption, non-repudiation and message integrity.
