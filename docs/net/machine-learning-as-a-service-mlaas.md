先决条件–[机器学习(ML)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/)

在这个科技的数字世界里，我们每天都在听机器学习和人工智能。像已经进入技术市场的[人工智能即服务](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-artificial-intelligence-as-a-service-aiaas-in-the-tech-industry/)一样，机器学习即服务也出现在科技行业。最近，福布斯预测全球机器学习市场将在未来 4 年从 73 亿美元增长到 306 亿美元。为此，[数据科学家](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-data-science/) & ML 人员必须继续构建模型，以满足客户的动态业务需求。但是仅仅建立模型是远远不够的，他们还必须考虑到许多过程，如

1.  Check new ideas
2.  Maintain these models.
3.  Improve sexual function

对于数据科学家来说，以一定的速度满足需求几乎是不可能的任务。在机器学习即服务的帮助下，他们可以轻松地处理这些问题。

**机器学习即服务(MLaaS) :**

机器学习即服务(MLaaS)是提供机器学习(ML)工具的一组服务，作为[云计算](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cloud-computing/)服务的组成部分。机器学习即服务中的服务提供商提供诸如[深度学习](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-deep-learning/)、数据可视化、预测分析、识别等工具。它还可以在消除基础设施问题方面发挥作用，如模型培训&评估、预处理等。

【MLaaS 实际上是如何工作的？

*   MLaaS is made on the cloud architecture, which consists of containers and [Kubernetes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-deep-learning/) , and lays the foundation for the solution of function as a service (FaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). Instead of providing a complete set of tools, the company can provide a fine-tuning ML model from the very beginning.
*   Its algorithm is used to search for patterns in data, because mathematical models are built by these models, which is helpful to predict new data.
*   The platform provides pattern recognition-probabilistic reasoning, and creates different methods to complete customized workflows according to the company's needs.

**我们能从 MLaaS 平台上期待什么**

1.  **Time saver:** MLAAS provides a way for data scientists to start ML quickly without some annoying software installation process.
2.  **Ease of use:** MLAAS puts forward the data center of the provider, where they can directly calculate the actual calculation, which is very convenient at every stage of business.
3.  **Access to ML tools:** MLAAS providers provide APIs such as medical care, face recognition and emotion analysis. For business, they also provide data visualization and predictive analysis.
4.  **Data management:** Many companies save their own data from the storage that they need to organize effectively to the cloud storage. MLA provides cloud storage here, and provides methods to manage these data in several ML experiments, such as data pipeline.

**使用 MLaaS 的好处:**

*   With the help of MLaaS, developers can easily access the pre-built models & algorithms, which is time-consuming, that is, now they can focus on, check and improve different parts of the project.
*   Similarly, by using AI, service business can improve its potential to provide services to customers, and regular and effective interaction with customers can provide more accurate business strategies.
*   Bring the result we hope to get from MLaaS settings & paying attention to the surge in revenue can play a role in business, otherwise it will be limited and costly to get a team of developers and engineers with key skills and knowledge.
*   MLaaS platform can be responsible for managing and storing data in small and medium-sized enterprises, which are highly lacking in the capacity of storing massive data.

**市场上一些流行的 MLaaS:**

1.  **Amazon ML:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) ML provides high-level automation functions, including CSV file, data loading from multiple servers, Amazon redshift and Amazon RDS. The service can determine valuable data processing methods through some sorting processes.
2.  **Azure ML:** The ML provided by Microsoft Azure Studios is suitable for both AI beginners and & professional players. MLaaS provides a simple browser-based environment, and provides a drag-and-drop & mechanism instead of coding. It also provides a large number of algorithms and many methods for developers to use.
3.  [t0 T0】 IBM Watson ML: Watson machine learning is an extensive service provider provided by Bluemix of IBM, aiming at meeting the needs of data scientists and developers. The service has its own visual model tool, which aims to quickly identify them and gain valuable insights, so that they can make decisions faster in the business.
4.  **Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine:** It is a user-friendly way to build ML models for data of any size. It also provides ML services for natural language processing, not only for image & video recognition, but also for speech & translation.

**何时不使用 MLaaS :**

服务 MLaaS 有很多优点和应用，它总是试图通过每天提供更好的服务来改变我们的生活，让我们的生活更加轻松。尽管如此，组织仍需要在某些点上避免多层自动分析，即

*   If data needs protection and internal deployment, we should prevent the use of multi-layer automatic analysis.
*   If the data needs a high level of optimization in the future, MLaaS may not be needed.
*   If you need to optimize the service cost of complex algorithms, then we may adopt internal infrastructure.
