如今，越来越多的网络在无线模式下无需电缆即可运行。无线局域网使用高频无线电信号、红外光束或激光在工作站、文件服务器或集线器之间进行通信。无线[局域网](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/local-area-network-lan-technologies/)是通过无线通信连接不同设备形成的一个区域网络。无线局域网遵循一个典型的命名为 IEEE 802.11。。这个网络很容易在家里或其他地方安装和使用。并且将它们连接到个人数字助理、台式计算机、工作站和打印机移动电话等。

**[【无线局域网络】](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wlan-full-form/) :**

*   A wireless local area network includes an access point for connecting to the network. The access point sends and receives frequency signals to connected devices. In 1990, the installation of WLAN was very expensive, and it was only deployed where wired connection was impossible. In the late 1990s, due to the use of IEEE 802.11 standard, the cost of WLAN was reduced.
*   The working bandwidth is 2\. 4 GHz(802.11 b) or 5 GHZ (802.11 a). Wireless LAN connected devices are also called clients. [Wireless Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-wi-fi/) Alliance may be a global non-profit organization, helping to ensure the standards and interoperability of wireless networks, which are usually called wireless networks.
*   WLAN gives a high data transmission rate. It uses a star, during which all nodes send/receive data through the access point. It is more effective at home and office. Especially in offices, no extra cables are needed, and it is easy to arrange parties. Is the knowledge transmission rate of 1-10 Mbps. Wireless LAN uses security including WEP or WPZ. If necessary, it also uses infrared technology.

**无线局域网的优势:**

*   This is a reliable way of communication.
*   Wireless local area network is a multi-functional communication mode because it reduces physical lines.
*   WLAN also reduces the value of ownership.
*   Easier to locate or remove workstations.
*   Due to the small coverage area, high speed is provided.
*   You can also move the workstation while maintaining the connection.
*   When breeding, you don't need sight and sunshine.
*   The connection direction is usually anywhere, that is, you can connect the device in any direction unless it is within the range of the access point.
*   Simple installation, no additional cables are needed during installation.
*   Wireless LAN is usually very useful in disaster situations such as earthquakes and fires. WIreless network can connect people in any disaster.
*   Because the regional visit is very small, it is very economical.
*   The more power it needs, because it uses a transmitter; Therefore, the battery life of notebook computers will be affected.

**无线局域网(WLAN)的缺点:**

*   WLAN requires a license.
*   The hidden area is limited.
*   The government can control the signal flow of WLAN, or limit it according to the need. This will affect the data transmission from the connected devices to the network.
*   If the number of connected devices increases, the data transmission rate decreases.
*   The frequency used by WLAN may interfere with other devices using the frequency.
*   If it rains or thunders, the communication may be disturbed.
*   Because of the low security, attackers can access the transmitted data.
*   Compared with using optical fiber, the signal may also be influenced by the environment.
*   Wireless LAN radiation is often harmful to the environment.
*   Wireless LAN is more expensive than wires and hubs as an access point.
*   The signal can be obtained from the nearest signal through the access point.
*   When the standard changes, the network card and access point need to be changed.
*   LAN cable is still necessary because of the backbone of wireless LAN.
*   Due to the frequency of WLAN, the data transmission rate is lower than that of wired connection.
*   The probability of error is high.
*   Communication is not secure and may be accessed by unauthorized users.
