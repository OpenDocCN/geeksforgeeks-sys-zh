**频分多址(FDMA) :**

频分多址是仅有的多址方法之一。在该方法中，信道带宽被细分为多个子信道。这种多路访问方法用于语音和数据传输。在这种方法中，一般的信道带宽由多个用户共享，因此各种用户可以同时传输他们的信息。FDMA 频谱内的相邻频带很可能相互干扰。因此，有必要在相邻频带之间加入保护频带。不需要码字和同步。使用 FDMA 降低了电源效率，这是一个古老而成熟的系统，用于模拟信号。

**FDMA 的优势:**

1.  The use of efficient digital coding increases the capacity.
2.  It reduces the value.
3.  Reduce intersymbol interference (equalization is not required).
4.  FDMA system is usually easy to implement, and the system is usually configured in this way, and the improvement of speech coder and bit rate reduction can even be easily combined.
5.  From the hardware point of view, the implementation is simple.
6.  The efficiency is quite high when the basic population remains unchanged and the traffic flow remains unchanged.
7.  FDMA includes its applicability to analog and digital transmission systems. The actual situation is that it doesn't need special coding, simple capacity allocation and network synchronization or timing. The baseband signals are often recovered by simple and cheap receiving equipment.
8.  Reducing the knowledge bit rate and using efficient digital codes can increase the capacity.
9.  Compared with the average delay spread, FDMA system uses low bit rate (large symbol time), which reduces the value and has low inter-symbol interference (ISI).
10.  Almost no equilibrium is needed.
11.  The technological progress required for implementation is simple. Generally, the system is configured to easily incorporate the improvement in bit rate reduction of speech coder.

**FDMA 的缺点:**

1.  Because a large number of frequencies are transmitted at the same time, there is the possibility of intermodulation distortion in the transponder.
2.  Only suitable for analog signals.
3.  It is impossible to store and enhance signals.
4.  Large bandwidth requirements for repeaters.
5.  Protective tape may waste production capacity.
6.  It requires the radio frequency (RF) filter to meet the strict specifications of adjacent channel suppression. This may increase the cost of the system.
7.  The network planning is cumbersome and time is tight.
8.  There is not much flexibility, so it is necessary to slowly change the traffic pattern that has been allocated.
9.  Traffic carrying capacity is relatively low.
10.  In general system, because the channel is allocated for a single user, the idle channel will increase the spectrum.
11.  Frequency planning takes time.
12.  Expensive multi-channel receivers are required.
13.  The maximum bit rate of each channel is fixed and small.
14.  It involves hardware narrowband filters and cannot be implemented in VLSI.
