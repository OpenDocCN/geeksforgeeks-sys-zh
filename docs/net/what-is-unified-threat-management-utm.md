在本文中，我们将了解统一威胁管理(UTM)以及它如何保护我们的计算机免受外部威胁和恶意软件的攻击。统一威胁管理(UTM)是处理网络上的攻击和恶意软件威胁的过程，以便在连接期间维护所有设备的安全。统一威胁管理的各种示例包括:

*   [antivirus software](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-an-antivirus-works/)
*   [firewall](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/)
*   [Spam detection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/protection-against-spam/)
*   [Intrusion detection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/intrusion-detection-system-ids/)
*   [Leakage prevention](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/)

### UTM 的特点:

UTM 的各种功能是:

*   Unified Threat Management (UTM) is a kind of software used to manage and protect the network vulnerable to harmful malware and viruses, which may damage the systems of all people connected to the network. It prevents this spyware and malware from entering the network and any devices connected to the network.
*   UTM is an effective resource, which enables developers to protect their Internet network on computers, while saving them a lot of time, money, manpower and expensive information technology infrastructure.
*   UTM is committed to developing effective algorithms and security modules to detect and warn all threats and attack signals before planned attacks on the network. In addition, UTM provides effective solutions to these threats, so that they can cause as little harm to the network and its customers as possible.
*   UTM supports content review and filtering to prevent junk content that may lead to cyber violence, crime or child safety problems.
*   UTM brought the latest definition of anti-virus software in advance, which may block harmful malware, spyware and so on. On their computer network. It has a database of predefined viruses in the system, and it will automatically stop viruses and delete them from the system.
*   It can efficiently and quickly process the data transmitted through the network. After UTM is enabled, the time for processing data is reduced, and now the transmission process is more secure and encrypted on the network.
*   Unified threat management also handles the retrieval of lost data. The network administrator is continuously monitoring the transmitted data. Even if the data is stolen, it will automatically recover all the data, and alert the system and stop the attacker before the data is stolen.
*   UTM firewall can scan and remove viruses, spyware, malware and Trojans. Meanwhile. All incoming and outgoing data are continuously monitored and tracked to monitor all incoming network threats in the form of malicious data.
*   The unified threat management system has been equipped with browser extension function, which can track users on the network and alert them when specific websites abuse their cookies by sending spyware and malware to their systems. Sometimes, it automatically blocks websites that do not have a secure network connection with https.
*   Today, Gmail and other service providers use UTM extensions in their services to mark and remove emails generated by spam, and warn users about this. These extensions scan the information of these emails and check whether they contain malicious spyware in the form of links, which can be used to track the members of the network.
*   UTM is equipped with incoming and outgoing intrusion detection algorithms to meet the connection terms and conditions of the network. In addition, it makes work easier, because we don't need different professional software to solve different purposes.

### UTM 的工作:

UTM 防火墙有两种类型:

*   Flow-based UTMs
*   Agent-based UTMs

在**基于流的 UTMs** 中，网络上的每个设备都物理连接到网络安全设备，该设备能够扫描网络数据，并查找病毒、间谍软件、恶意软件或来自网站的任何攻击，如 DDoS 攻击、DNS 放大攻击和入侵攻击。

在**基于代理的 UTMs** 中，安装并启用了网络安全软件，如防病毒软件，或连接到专用 VPN 或使用 IPS 系统。此外，为了安全起见，安装了代理服务器，以便首先将所有数据传输到该服务器，然后在作为安全措施被该服务器彻底扫描后再传输到所有其他设备。

### UTM 和防火墙的区别:

*   防火墙的职责只是扫描通过计算机传入和传出的数据，寻找可能破坏系统的恶意病毒、间谍软件和恶意软件。
*   而 UTM 不仅负责管理一台特定的计算机，而是扫描该网络上的所有计算机系统和服务器。它跟踪和监控网络上所有传输的数据，并寻找恶意对象。
*   UTM 比防火墙有更广泛的用途。服务提供商也使用 UTM 进行垃圾邮件检测、入侵、过滤流量、管理网络设备等。

### UTM 的缺点:

UTM 有很多优点，但同时也有一些相当多的缺点:

*   UTM is not satisfied with the privacy of network members and users. In order to protect the nodes on the network from data leakage, it will keep track of the traffic and network history of all members of the network.
*   UTM leads to the degradation of processor performance, because spyware will capture most of the computer's memory in these security processes, which will lead to the inefficiency of actual work on the network.
