**L2F** 或**第二层转发**是思科系统开发的隧道协议。它用于在互联网上建立虚拟专用网络(VPn)，从而提供传输安全数据包的便利。它主要用于点对点协议产生的流量的隧道传输，即用于将点对点协议数据包从客户端转发到远程节点。它在互联网服务提供商和企业客户之间创建了一个安全的端到端隧道。L2F 协议是第 2 层隧道协议(L2TP)的一部分。

**特征:**

*   L2F is isolated from the details of the media, that is, it provides an abstract facility for tunnel establishment.
*   L2F provides a packet-oriented tunnel consisting of point-to-point connections.
*   L2F is equipped with an unexplained framework, which can operate these features without knowing them clearly.
*   L2F is compatible with the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and challenge handshake authentication protocol (CHAP).
*   L2F is compatible with Apple's AppleTalk Remote Access Protocol (ARAP).
*   L2F's packet format is subject to generic routing encapsulation (GRE)

的启发

**优势:**

*   Create an end-to-end tunnel to ensure data encapsulation and secure transmission.
*   L2F protocol is more secure because it can be used perfectly with other security protocols.
*   L2F can provide user authentication through remote authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS), dynamic address allocation and server-side QoS.
*   L2F tunnel can support multiple connections.

**缺点:**

*   L2F does not provide encryption facilities, but relies on the protocol being tunneled to provide privacy.
*   L2F does not provide data flow control.
*   L2F does not provide attribute value pair hiding.
