PIN 是**个人识别号**的缩写。个人识别码是用户创建的安全数字代码，当用户试图访问系统时用于身份验证。

对于各种类型的系统和网络，如计算机网络、移动电话等，个人识别码被用作验证工具。PINs 最常见的用法是在自动柜员机、互联网交易、计算机访问或登录网站等。

**个人识别码的特征:**

*   When a user attempts to access the system using the personal identification code, the personal identification code provided by the user is verified by comparing it with the personal identification code stored in the system database of the specific user. After successfully verifying the PIN, the user is granted access to the specific system. But the personal identification number can't identify the user.
*   A typical pin is a short string of numbers. Typically, they range from 4 to 12 digits. However, this scheme is not so secure, so additional constraints or measures need to be taken to ensure proper security. For example, if the opponent (or the user himself) tries more than the pre-specified number of incorrect pins, the physical device should be invalid.

**PIN 的优势:**

*   PIN provides security for system users.
*   In case of unauthorized access due to lost card, user name or password PIN provides secure privacy management.
*   PIN provides access to various types of network systems and websites.

使用个人识别码没有缺点，因为个人识别码提供了安全性。但是使用强密码是非常明智的，因为常用的或容易破解的密码可能会导致严重的问题。
