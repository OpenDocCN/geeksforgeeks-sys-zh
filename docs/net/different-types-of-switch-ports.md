网络设备通过交换机端口连接到交换机。*开关端口*是插入数据电缆以连接设备的物理开口。交换机端口类型应根据需求进行配置，并考虑网络架构、速度和功能等因素。

基于网络架构，交换机端口可分为以下类型:

1.**接入端口:**

*   An access port is a connection on a switch for transmitting data to and from a specific VLAN.
*   Used to connect the switch to host devices such as desktops, laptops and printers. , available only in access links.
*   It sends and receives Ethernet frames in unmarked form from the access VLAN.
*   Can only be a member of a single VLAN, that is, an access VLAN, and discard all frames that are not included in the access VLAN.

2.**中继端口:**

*   中继端口是交换机上的一个连接，用于在多个虚拟局域网之间传输数据。
*   它用于将交换机连接到中继链路中可用的其他交换机、路由器和服务器。
*   当帧在交换机之间移动时，会用唯一的识别标签进行标记，以便将它们定向到指定的虚拟局域网。
*   它可以同时管理多个虚拟局域网的流量。

3.**混合端口:**

*   A hybrid port is a connection on a switch for transferring data between one or more virtual LANs.
*   Used to connect network devices (such as switches) and user devices (such as laptops).
*   It supports marked frames and unmarked frames from virtual LAN.
*   It can simultaneously receive frames from one or more virtual LANs.

根据功能，交换机端口可以分为以下类型:

1.**组合端口:**

*   It is a composite port, which can support two different physical ports with the same switch structure and port number, but these two ports cannot be used at the same time.
*   Used to configure switches according to application requirements.

2.**堆叠端口:**

*   Is a special functional port for connecting other stackable switches of the same model, brand and software version. It operates as a single stackable switch, and the port capacity is equal to the sum of combined switches.
*   Used for long distance connection.

3. **PoE(以太网供电)端口:**

*   It allows a single network cable to transmit data and power simultaneously.
*   It is used in devices such as wireless network repeaters or IP security cameras, which use a single Ethernet cable to transmit voice, data and power.

根据功能，交换机端口可以分为以下类型:

1. **RJ45 端口:**

*   The registration jack 45 (RJ45) is an Ethernet-style network port, which is used to interact or communicate with other devices that need Ethernet networking.
*   Supports speeds up to 100 Mbps.
*   Used for server switching in data center, LAN, uplink of desktop switch, etc.

2. **SFP 端口:**

*   Small form factor pluggable (SFP) port is a slot on a network device into which SFP transceiver is inserted.
*   It enables Gigabit switches to connect to a variety of optical fiber and Ethernet cables, so as to extend the switching function to the whole network.
*   Up to 1 Gbps speed is supported.
*   It enables Gigabit switches to realize long-distance fiber uplink or short-distance copper uplink.

3. **SFP+端口:**

*   SFP+ port is an advanced version of SFP port, which supports higher data rate.
*   Up to 10 Gbps speed is supported.
*   The SFP+ transceiver cannot be plugged into the SFP port because SFP+ does not support speeds below 1Gbps.

4. **SFP28 端口:**

*   SFP28 is an enhanced version of SFP+, which is specially designed for 25G signal transmission.
*   Up to 25 Gbps speed is supported.
*   Used for networking upgrade.

5. **QSFP+端口:**

*   The four-channel small form factor +(QSFP+) port has four channels and supports four times the speed of the corresponding SFP (SFP+ here).
*   Up to 40 Gbps speed is supported.
*   It has four channels of 10 Gbps SFP+ interfaces.

6. **QSFP28 端口:**

*   The four-channel small form factor 28 (QSFP28) port has four channels and supports four times the speed of the corresponding SFP (SFP28 here).
*   Up to 100 Gbps speed is supported.
*   There are four-channel 25 Gbps SFP28 interfaces.
