为了将轶事场景置于结构化框架中，国际标准化组织(ISO)创建了一个网络管理模型。

**网络管理领域:**
这些是网络管理领域，定义如下:

*   **Performance Management:**
    To quantify, measure, report, analyze, and control the performance (e.g, utilization and throughput) of different network components are the main goal of performance management. These components include individual [devices](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-devices-hub-repeater-bridge-switch-router-gateways/) (e.g, links, routers, and hosts) as well as the end to end abstraction such as a path through the network. Protocol standard such as the [Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/) play a central role in Internet performance management.

*   **Fault Management:**
    The goal of fault management is to log, detect, and respond to fault condition int the network. The difference between fault management and performance management is blurred.
    The fault management is used to manage immediate handling of the failures like link failure, host failure, or router hardware problem, these problems are also known as a transient network failure. With the help of performance management, the SNMP protocol plays a major part in fault management.
*   **Configuration Management:**
    Tracking of the devices that are on the managed network and the hardware and software configurations are allowed by Configuration management.
*   **Accounting Management:**
    To specify, log, and control user and device access to network resources are allowed by Accounting management. usage quotas, usage-based charging, and the allocation of resource-access privileges all fall under accounting management.
*   **安全管理:**
    安全管理的目标是根据一些定义明确的策略来控制对网络资源的访问。关键配送中心是网络管理的一个组成部分。
    使用防火墙监控外部网络接入点是另一个重要组成部分。
