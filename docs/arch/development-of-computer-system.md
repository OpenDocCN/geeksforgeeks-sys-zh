这台计算机是由一位名叫查尔斯·巴贝奇的教授设计的。他还设计了作为计算机系统基本框架结构的分析引擎。计算机被分为三代，每一代都持续一段时间，每一代都给我们一台新的计算机。

计算机是用于计算和运算的机械装置，它远不止于此。计算机是一台灵活的机器，可以处理数据并将其转换成信息。事实上，今天这一代人已经开始遵循一套程序，从数字计数设备进行各种计算，这是第一个被称为算盘的计算设备。

**算盘:**

*   The first mechanical computing device used for calculation is called abacus. It is very easy and faster to perform addition and subtraction. It was first developed by Egyptians, but later, its final shape was given by Chinese educators.
*   The abacus is composed of a wooden frame, on which there is a rod with round beads on it, and the round beads slide alternately on the rod. Usually, the abacus device is divided into two parts, called heaven and earth, in which the sky is its upper part and the earth is its lower part.
*   Although, in the abacus, any number can be expressed or calculated by placing each bead in its proper position.
*   Therefore, in short, abacus is a counting tool or device used to calculate and perform various mathematical functions, which is easy to produce skills such as visualization, memory, accuracy and creativity.

**纳皮尔的骨头:**

*   它是约翰·耐普尔在 1617 年发明的。
*   它也是一种手动操作的操作装置，用于计算给定数字的商和积。
*   它看起来像一个棋盘游戏，里面有一个边框。各种各样的杆被放置在轮圈内，用于计算印在杆上的数字。
*   它是那个时期发明的较好的计算装置。

**帕斯卡计算器:**

*   In 1642, a French scientist named Blaise Pascal invented an addition machine called Pascal calculation.
*   Usually, the position of each number is indicated by means of gears.
*   In this case, the goal is to perform basic calculations and operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and so on. It is made of metal.
*   Turn the wheel clockwise to calculate the number.

**莱布尼茨计算器:**

*   In 1671, a scientist named gottfried leibniz generally improved Pascal calculator. He designed his own machine to perform various mathematical calculations based on multiplication and division.
*   It is also called Leibniz wheel or ladder calculator.
*   Is the machine type of the engine used to calculate a kind of mechanical calculator.

**分析引擎:**

*   Charles Babbage invented the analysis engine in 1833\. It was created to protect our data security.
*   It includes all functions used in today's computer language. Because of his great invention, Charles Babbage is also known as the father of computers.
*   It is created for general purpose, and it is also fully programmed. It is also an automatic mechanical digital computer. It is usually programmed with punched cards.
*   Although the development of digital computers is rooted in abacus, early mechanical computing devices were also invented.
