**对超级计算机的需求:**

*   In India, the demand for [supercomputer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-supercomputer-and-mainframe-computer/) is necessary to improve the monsoon forecasting ability. In the mid-1980s, India urgently needed this because it was difficult for them to obtain it from the United States. Therefore, what India needs to solve is that the second and third best available computers (CRAY XMP-14) are provided in sales, so CRAY XMP-14 is purchased by India because there is no other choice to obtain it.
*   When IISC (Indian Institute of Science) asked for a second supercomputer, the U.S. government refused to agree, so this incident made Indian computer scientists think about this problem and wake up from a deep sleep, because they made progress and built a supercomputer by themselves.
*   Now, the stage has come when India can boast of its native supercomputer models, which can do almost the same work as imported supercomputers, even at a fraction of the cost of imported supercomputers. All this happened because of the carefully planned efforts of a special team, so we all thank them for their work and efforts, which made India enter the list of developing supercomputers like other countries.

**超级计算机历史:**

*   The first supercomputer that appeared in it was called Flosolver, which is the National Aviation Laboratory in Bangalore, and now we call it nal National Aerospace Laboratory.
*   At the Center of Atmospheric Science of Indian Institute of Science (IISC), the latest version of Flosolver system in Bangalore is called Flosolver Mk3.
*   For Indian metrology department, the function of Flosolver Mk3 is about half that of Cray XMP purchased by designers, but its price is only one tenth of Cray machine.
*   Decided to own a supercomputer as a national defense research and development institution. Another discovered system is PACE (Aerodynamic Computing and Evaluation Processor), which was developed by the Advanced Numerical Research and Analysis Group in Hyderabad.
*   CRAY-level speed is realized by PACE. PACE's speed is about 100 megabits. It doesn't need a special cooling device like CRAY. Even if it is very big, we can say that PACE has a great advantage.

**PARAM** **超级计算机——印度制造:**

*   In the world market, the Indian supercomputer left its mark is a multi-purpose high-speed machine named PARAM, which was developed by the Advanced Computing Development Center (C-DAC) in Pune.
*   The peak performance of up to 1 gigabyte appears in PARAM 8000 with 256 processing points, which is the cheapest supercomputer in the world compared with some of the most advanced supercomputers launched at the price of 200 million rupees in 1991.
*   Subsequently, with the development of PARAM 8600 and PARAM 9000, PARAM 8000 was upgraded, and PARAM PADMA, which was launched in 2003, was the latest in ParamSeries.
*   PARAM PADMA, a process with 1 trillion times per second, has 1tb of power, which was previously only applicable to countries such as the United States and Japan.
*   The storage capacity is 5tb, which can be increased by 22tb, and it costs $10 million to develop in PARAM PADMA. India plans to sell Param Padma internationally.
*   The early version of Param10,000, a supercomputer with 100 gigabytes of memory (floating-point operations per second), has been sold in eight countries including Germany, Russia, Singapore and Canada.
