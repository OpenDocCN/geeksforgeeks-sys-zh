可见发光二极管和不可见发光二极管是两类发光二极管。发光的波长或颜色取决于材料的禁带或能隙。

**LED 的种类:**

*   Gallium phosphide (gap)–red, yellow and green
*   Algallium phosphide (AlGaP)–Green
*   Gallium nitride (gan)–green, emerald green
*   Gallium arsenide (GaAs)- infrared
*   Gallium arsenide (gaasp)–red to infrared, orange
*   Aluminum gallium phosphide (AlGaAs SP)-High brightness red, orange red, orange and yellow
*   Indium gallium nitride (GaInN)-

**LED 的应用:**

1.  Camera phone and digital watch
2.  Camera and car heating lamp
3.  aircraft lighting
4.  Digital computer and calculator
5.  Traffic signal and anti-theft alarm system
6.  Microprocessor and multiplexer

**LED 的优势:**

*   The LED runs very fast.
*   These can emit different colors of light.
*   LEDs do not contain toxic substances, such as mercury used in fluorescent lamps.
*   The brightness of LED can be easily controlled by changing the current.
*   These are smaller in size, lighter in weight and longer in life.
*   These are cheap, readily available and low in energy consumption.

**LED 的缺点:**

*   The efficiency of LED is low, and it needs more power than normal pn junction diode to work.
