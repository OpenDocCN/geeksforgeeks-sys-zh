**先决条件–**[分析引擎](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-difference-engine-and-analytical-engine/)

分析引擎是通用机械计算机引擎，它是一个完全程序控制的机器，其中也有一个自动机械数字计算机。它是用穿孔卡片编程的，能够执行之前设置的任何计算。它包括集成内存、程序流控制和算术逻辑单元。任何有限的计算都可以由分析引擎执行。

**优势:**

*   An optimized memory is being integrated into the analysis engine.
*   It includes integrated memory, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), and power flowing into it in the context of various loops and implicit branches.
*   The analysis engine is the successor of the difference engine.
*   The analysis engine includes various cycles and conditions in the machine programming language.
*   Includes a combination of physically pinned CPU and ALU.
*   The analysis engine supports various performance sources, such as punched cards, printed copies in digital format and chart drawing.
*   First of all, it is designed for a special purpose device, which is defined as Turing complete.
*   In the analysis engine, the rotary drum meets the requirements of different lathes.

**劣势:**

*   Charles Babbage died, so the analysis engine is still incomplete.
*   The analysis engine is a comprehensive computer.
*   It has its own personal nature.
*   Many summaries of layouts cannot be provided or supported.
*   Due to its mechanical difficulty, the analysis engine has not yet been built.
