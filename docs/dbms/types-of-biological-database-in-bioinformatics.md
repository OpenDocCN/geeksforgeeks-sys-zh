**生物** [**数据库**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-databases/) **:**

*   These databases are organized by biological data such as protein sequencing, molecular structure, [DNA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dna-protein-python-3/) sequence, etc.
*   There are several computer tools that can manipulate [biological data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/characteristics-of-biological-data-genome-data-management/) , such as updating, deleting and inserting. Scientists and researchers from all over the world input their experimental data and results into biological databases so that a wider audience can use them.
*   Biological database can be used freely, and it contains a huge collection of various biological data.

**生物数据库的用途:**

*   It helps researchers to study existing data and form new papers, [Antiviral](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-antivirus-and-antispyware/) , beneficial bacteria, drugs and so on.
*   It helps scientists understand the concept of biological phenomena.
*   [The database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/) serves as a memory for information.
*   Help to remove data redundancy.

**生物数据库类型:**

基本上有 3 种类型的生物数据库如下。

**1。主要数据库:**

*   It can also be called archive database, because it archives the experimental results submitted by scientists. The original database is full of experimental data, such as genome sequence, macromolecular structure and so on. The data entered here remains unchanged (without any modification to the data).
*   It obtains unique data from the laboratory, which is accessible to normal users without any change.
*   The login number will be given when entering the data database. The same data can be retrieved later using the registration number. The registration number uniquely identifies each piece of data and will never change.

**示例–**

*   Examples of primary databases-nucleic acid databases are GenBank and DDBJ.

**2。二级数据库:**

*   The data stored in these types of databases are the analysis results of primary databases. The algorithm is applied to the main database, and meaningful information data is stored in the auxiliary database.
*   The data here is highly accurate (process the data before it appears in the database). Compared with the main database, the auxiliary database is better and contains more valuable knowledge.

**示例–**

辅助数据库的示例如下。

*   InterPro (protein family, motif and domain)
*   UniProt knowledge base (sequence and function information of protein)

**3。复合数据库:**

*   The data entered in these types of databases are first compared and then filtered according to the required criteria.
*   The initial data is taken from the main database, and then combined together according to certain conditions.
*   Help quickly search the sequence. The composite database contains non-redundant data.
