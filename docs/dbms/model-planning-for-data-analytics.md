在本文中，我们将讨论数据分析的模型规划，其中我们将逐一介绍所有过程步骤。

模型规划是数据分析生命周期阶段的第 3 阶段，在此阶段，团队确定其打算为后续模型构建阶段遵循的方法、技术和工作流。

在此阶段，该团队参考在发现过程中开发的假设，在此阶段，他们首先熟悉数据并了解业务问题或领域。

**模型规划阶段的常用工具:**

**R–**

*   Its basic advantage is that it can easily develop high-quality plots, including the required mathematical formulas.
*   The most famous use of SQL is as an infrastructure to build its dashboard, which is easy to use with reporting tools.
*   In order to create and interact with databases faster, SQL has been adapted into various tools, each of which has its own niche market, including Microsoft Access and PostgreSQL.

**SQL–**

*   It is easy to access, can be used for making complex models and rapid analysis, and provides deep data manipulation ability.
*   The SQL server monitoring part of the application manager is in tabular format, which is convenient to switch between real-time data screen and analysis function access.
*   Get data widely through intuitive interface, regardless of where the data is stored.
*   You can easily access data with little knowledge of SQL required for data or surface data.
*   Work easily through the seamless interface with loaders, and can be used without knowing each loader in detail.
*   Through basic storage options, including materialist view, temporary table and partition table, the efficiency is improved.

**Tableau Public–**

*   It is a free software that can be connected to any data source to obtain the company's network-based data.
*   It allows access to downloaded files in different formats.
*   Data can be shared through social media.
*   If anyone wants to see the superiority of tableau, this is a very good data source.

**SAS–**

*   It is a programming environment and language for data operation.
*   SAS is easy to manage and access, and is used to observe data from various sources.
*   SAS organizes modules for network, social media and marketing analysis widely used in customer prospects.
*   It is also used to predict customer behavior and communication.

**RapidMiner–**

*   It is a strongly integrated platform in the field of data science, which performs predictive analysis.
*   It includes advanced analysis such as data mining and machine learning, without any programming.
*   This tool is very powerful and can generate analysis based on real data.
