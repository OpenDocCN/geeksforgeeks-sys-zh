[数据库管理系统(DBMS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-dbms-database-management-system-set-1/) 是一组程序，通过考虑适当的安全措施，允许访问、检索和使用该数据。数据库管理系统对于更好的数据集成及其安全性非常有用。

**数据库管理系统(DBMS)的优势:**
部分如下。

1.  **Better Data Transferring:**
    Database management creates a place where users have an advantage of more and better managed data. Thus making it possible for end-users to have a quick look and to respond fast to any changes made in their environment.

2.  **Better Data Security:**
    As number of users increases data transferring or data sharing rate also increases thus increasing the risk of data security. It is widely used in corporation world where companies invest money, time and effort in large amount to ensure data is secure and is used properly. A Database Management System (DBMS) provide a better platform for data privacy and security policies thus, helping companies to improve Data Security.
3.  **Better data integration:**
    Due to Database Management System we have an access to well managed and synchronized form of data thus it makes data handling very easy and gives integrated view of how a particular organization is working and also helps to keep a track on how one segment of the company affects other segment.
4.  **Minimized Data Inconsistency:**
    Data inconsistency occurs between files when different versions of the same data appear in different places.
    For Example, data inconsistency occurs when a student name is saved as “John Wayne” on a main computer of school but on teacher registered system same student name is “William J. Wayne”, or when the price of a product is $86.95 in local system of company and its National sales office system shows the same product price as $84.95.
    So if a database is properly designed then Data inconsistency can be greatly reduced hence minimizing data inconsistency.
5.  **Faster data Access:**
    The Data base management system (DBMS) helps to produce quick answers to database queries thus making data accessing faster and more accurate. For example, to read or update the data. For example, end users, when dealing with large amounts of sale data, will have enhanced access to the data, enabling faster sales cycle.
    Some queries may be like:
    *   最近三个月销售额增加了多少？
    *   在过去的五个月里，每位销售人员的奖金是多少？
    *   有多少客户信用评分在 850 分以上？
6.  **Better decision making:**
    Due to DBMS now we have Better managed data and Improved data accessing because of which we can generate better quality information hence on this basis better decisions can be made.
    Better Data quality improves accuracy, validity and time it takes to read data.
    DBMS does not guarantee data quality, it provides a framework to make it is easy to improve data quality .
7.  **Increased end-user productivity:**
    The data which is available with the help of combination of tools which transform data into useful information, helps end user to make quick, informative and better decisions that can make difference between success and failure in the global economy.
8.  **简单:**
    数据库管理系统(DBMS)给出简单明了的数据逻辑视图。许多操作，如文件或数据的插入、删除或创建，都很容易实现。
