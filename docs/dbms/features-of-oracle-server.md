[甲骨文服务器](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comparisons-between-oracle-vs-sql-server/)是一个关系数据库管理系统，提供了一种开放、完整和集成的信息管理方法。Oracle 服务器由一个 Oracle 数据库和一个 Oracle 实例组成。以下是 oracle 的特性:

1.  **Client/server architecture-** In order to make full use of distributed systems, Oracle can allow processing to be divided into client and server applications. Therefore, for the purpose of distributed processing, it is based on client/server architecture.
2.  **Large database and spatial management-** Oracle Bone Inscriptions can support the largest database. It allows full control of the used space so that hardware devices can be used effectively.
3.  **High availability-** It will never stop running or be unavailable. Therefore, all normal operations (such as backup or partial failure) will not interrupt the use of the database.
4.  **Multi-concurrent database users-** Oracle Bone Inscriptions server minimizes disputes between data and ensures data concurrency.
5.  **Open industry standards-** Oracle Bone Inscriptions follows industry-recognized standards in data access language, user interface, operating system and other network protocols. One of the advantages is that it is an "open" system to protect customers' investment.
6.  **Enforce database integrity-** Oracle Bone Inscriptions enforces data integrity, which is the guarantee of data consistency. Therefore, the cost of coding and managing checks is eliminated in many database applications.
7.  **Portability-** Oracle software can be ported to multiple operating systems to work. Applications developed with Oracle can be ported to other operating systems without any changes.
8.  **Compatibility-** Oracle software is compatible with the standards of various industries. Applications developed for oracle can be compatible with many other systems without much modification.
9.  **Controllable availability-** Another great feature of Oracle is that availability is controllable, and each level (or even sub-level) is controllable. For example, the administrator can also prohibit certain specific applications from being packaged or loaded without affecting other applications.
10.  **Concurrent processing-** Oracle allows multiple concurrent users to execute multiple applications concurrently. Oracle allows you to run multiple applications at the same time.
11.  **Replication environment-** Oracle software allows users to replicate multiple groups of tables and their supporting objects to multiple sites.
12.  **High transaction performance-** Oracle also maintains a high overall system performance. Users will not be affected by slow processing performance.
13.  **Manageable security-** In order to prevent unauthorized database access and use, Oracle provides fail-safe functions to limit and monitor data access.
14.  **Distributed system-** Oracle is based on distributed system, which has the same degree of user transparency and data consistency as non-distributed system, and has the advantage of local database management.
