数据库安全以保护数据库免受意外、偶然或有意威胁而闻名。这些威胁可能基于也可能不基于计算机。威胁是将影响数据库安全和组织运作的任何情况或事件。这种威胁可能会给组织造成巨大损失。数据库不可用将严重影响组织的绩效。

不可用会给组织带来巨大损失。

1.  **Data security risks –**
    Database security is the main part for the database of the entire organization. The organization must recognize all the factors that may lead to risks in future and all the elements that are weak of the database from the viewpoint of the database.
2.  **Data tampering –**
    Data tempering is the act of intentional modification of the data. The chances of the data tempering are more when the data is distributed because data moves from one site to another.So, the privacy is essential to secure the data so that it can’t be viewed or modified by the unintended user.

3.  **Data theft –**
    Data must be transferred and stored safely, so that some important information such as bank details can’t be stolen.
4.  **False user identity –**
    In distributed systems, the unintended users can easily gain access to the sensitive and important information by using a false identity. These unintended users can gain important information .They can steal bank details, unique codes that can be used somewhere else.
5.  **Password related threats –**
    In huge organizations users have to remember multiple passwords for different services they use for security concerns. Users can manage multiple passwords in following ways-
    *   用户可以使用容易猜到的密码。
    *   用户可以为每个站点选择相同的密码，也可以使用标准密码。

    然而，多重密码昂贵、难以管理且复杂。

6.  **Unauthorized Access to Tables and columns –**
    The database may contain some data that is restricted by the unauthorized user. This data can be confidential tables, confidential rows or column. There should be a possibility of the protection for the confidential data.
7.  **Lack of accountability –**
    If the system administrator is not able to find users activities, then users can’t be held responsible for their activities. There should be a way to monitor all the actions being performed by the user.
8.  **复杂的用户管理需求–**
    系统必须能够支持大量用户，因此必须具有可扩展性。在大规模系统环境中，管理用户帐户和密码的负担使得系统不受攻击和错误的影响。
