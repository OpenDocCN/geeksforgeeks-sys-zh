基本上，数据库管理系统的选择由许多因素决定，例如:

1.  技术

2.  经济学

3.  组织政治

这里我们将主要讨论非技术因素，包括供应商的财务状况和支持组织。在本文中，我们将集中讨论影响数据库管理系统选择的经济和组织因素。在选择数据库管理系统时，需要考虑以下成本:

*   **Software acquisition cost –** 
    This is basically the up-front cost of software or buying cost of software including language options, different types of interfaces. The correct DBMS version for a specific OS must be selected. Basically, the Development tools, design tools, and additional language support are not included in basic pricing. 
*   **Maintenance cost –** 
    This is basically the recurring cost of receiving standard maintenance service from the vendor and to keep the DBMS version up-to-date. 
*   **Hardware acquisition cost –** 
    We may need hardware components such as memory, disk drives, controllers, archival storage etc cost of all these also we need to consider while choosing a DBMS. 
*   **Personal cost –** 
    Acquisition of DBMS software for the first time by an organization is often accompanied by a reorganization of the data processing department. The position of DBA and staff exist in most companies and that have adopted DBMS. 
*   **Training cost –** 
    DBMS are often complex systems personal must often be trained to use and program for DBMS. Training is required at all levels which include programming, application development and database administration. 
*   **Operating cost –** 
    Cost of operating database also needs to be considered while choosing DBMS.
