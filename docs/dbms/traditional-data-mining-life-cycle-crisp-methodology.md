**传统数据挖掘生命周期:**
数据生命周期是特定信息单元从其起始时代或捕获到其有价值生命结束时可能被记录和/或取消所经历的阶段安排。这个周期与 Crisp 方法论中描述的更传统的信息挖掘周期有着肤浅的相似之处。

**步骤传统数据挖掘生命周期:**

1.  **Business Understanding:**
    This introductory stage centers on understanding the extend destinations and prerequisites from a commerce point of view, and after that changing over this information into a information mining issue definition. A preliminary arrange is planned to attain the destinations. A choice show, particularly one built utilizing the Choice Demonstrate and Documentation standard can be utilized.

2.  **Data Understanding:**
    The information understanding stage begins with an starting information collection and continues with exercises in arrange to induce commonplace with the information, to distinguish information quality issues, to find to begin with experiences into the information, or to distinguish curiously subsets to create speculations for covered up data.
3.  **Information arrangement:**
    Information arrangement errands are likely to be performed numerous times, and not in any endorsed arrange. Assignments incorporate table, record, and trait choice as well as change and cleaning of information for modeling apparatuses.
4.  **Modeling:**
    In this stage, different modeling strategies are chosen and connected and their parameters are calibrated to ideal values. Regularly, there are a few procedures for the same information mining issue sort. A few procedures have particular prerequisites on the frame of information. Subsequently, it is frequently required to step back to the information planning stage.
5.  **Evaluation:**
    At this organize within the extend, you’ve got built a demonstrate (or models) that shows up to have tall quality, from a information examination viewpoint. Some time recently proceeding to last sending of the show, it is vital to assess the demonstrate altogether and audit the steps executed to build the show, to be certain it legitimately accomplishes the trade objectives. A key objective is to decide on the off chance that there’s a few vital commerce issue that has not been adequately considered. At the conclusion of this stage, a choice on the utilize of the information mining comes about ought to be come to.
6.  **部署:**
    这部剧的创作大体上不是延伸的结论。事实上，如果演示的目的是扩展信息的信息，那么所获得的知识将不得不以对客户有价值的方式进行组织和展示。根据先决条件，发送阶段可以像创建报告一样简单，也可以像执行可重复的信息评分(例如，部分分配)或信息挖掘准备一样复杂。
