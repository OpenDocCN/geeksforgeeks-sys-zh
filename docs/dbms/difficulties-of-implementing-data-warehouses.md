以下是**实现数据仓库**

**困难**

2.  Construction, management and quality control are important operational problems in data warehouse.
3.  When implementing a data warehouse, some important and challenging considerations are: the design, construction and implementation of the warehouse.
4.  Building enterprise-level warehouses in large organizations is a major undertaking.
5.  Manual data processing may endanger the correctness of the data being input.
6.  Intensive enterprises manage data warehouses, which is directly proportional to the complexity and scale of warehouses.
7.  The complexity of management should be understood by organizations trying to manage data warehouses.
8.  Must have the flexibility to accept and integrate analysis to simplify the business intelligence process.
9.  In order to deal with evolution, the mode of acquiring components and warehouses should be updated.
10.  A significant problem of data warehouse is data quality control. The main concerns are: data quality and consistency.
11.  Consistency is still a major problem faced by database administrators.
12.  One of the main challenges of differences in naming, domain definition and identification number is the fusion of data from different sources.
13.  Whenever the source database changes, the data warehouse administrator must consider the possible interaction with warehouse elements.
14.  The data should be accurate. The efficiency and work of the warehouse are only used as data to support its operation.
15.  Before building a data warehouse, the usage forecast should be conservatively estimated and constantly revised to reflect the current demand.
16.  In order to adapt to the increase and loss of data sources, warehouses should be designed. This also avoids major redesign.
17.  Source and source data will evolve constantly, and the warehouse must adapt to such changes.
18.  Another continuous challenge is to fit the available source data into the data model of the warehouse. This is because the demand and capacity of the warehouse will change with the passage of time, because the technology will change rapidly.
19.  Traditional database management needs more extensive data warehouse management skills.
20.  Managing data warehouses in large organizations, designing management functions and selecting management teams of database warehouses are some main tasks.

**实现数据仓库的一些最佳实践:**

1.  The data warehouse must be built incrementally.
2.  The user's expectation that the project he completed should be managed.
3.  Politics is very important.
4.  Adaptability should be built in.
5.  Developing business/supplier relationship is the best practice.
